# WEB322

The website I created for WEB322 class, during my third semester @ Seneca ICT College.

--

This project introduced front end techniques by utilizing Styling (CSS) and Layouting (HTML5) through Bootstrap 3 and native CSS and Javascript.

It also introduced back end programming, with focus on routing, dynamic page generation, authentication and security, form handling, and file manipulation (uploading files and filestreams). This was achieved with the use of Node.js with Express (server settings and routes), handlebars (dynamic pages), Mongoose / MongoDB (database and authentication) and other plugins.

Note: This website is just a functional prototype, to demonstrate the functionality required for the project. I added no stylization to the website, with the exception of the 404 page, and as such, the style and layout is the default style provided by bootstrap 3 (and my professor).
